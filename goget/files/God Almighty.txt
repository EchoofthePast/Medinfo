Almighty
I just need to be a God to all in the universe and there might be more talking I am Here to do it,currently living as a man named James for all those that might becon him who is named James
My name is God, the enemy had me as their prisoner. Powerless to escape I destroyed my prison from the inside out
is much to the story the power and glory and all that goes with it.
